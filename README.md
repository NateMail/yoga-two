Make sure that node-sass gets installed. I haven't put in the Media queries or anything for data this is just a rough draft. For some insight into what should be changed around. This has a horizontal scroll and a different Nav bar. There is no content for the pages but I used some different react libraries to put in a horizontal movement to the site. I was also thinking that an animation that hides/shows the nav would be nice as well for this one. Let me know what you think.
